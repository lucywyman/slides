Are Our Tests Any Good?

Notes: 
- 30 minute talk

Outline:
- Roadmap
- What is QAELK?
- Why did we build it?
  - What questions does it answer?
  - What makes a test "valuable"?
    - Which tests tell us our code is broken?
    - Perception vs reality -- tests are perceived as more or less valuable than they are
    - Cost of tests -- which tests take longer to run than they are "worth"?
    - Cost of maintenance / running time / resources
    - flaky?
    - Transients?
    - never failing?
    - Is it a problem with tests or code?
    - How do you identify a "bad test"?
    - Did we learn anything from this test? Video game scoring
    - Future ideas: 
      - sub systems integrated together
      - qaelk = repo of test run data <--> jira integration (bordain?)(what bugs were found by tests?)  --> report back to jira if an issue was fixed or not
      - testrail (cry)
    - More subtopics here (What is a flaky test? Does a test that never fails provide value? etc.)
- What decisions / actions have we made based on data from QAELK
  - What will you do when you find out XYZ about ABC metrics?
  - Refactor, throw away, or do nothing, put into different testing tier
- Possibly a demo
- Future plans / hopes / dreams
- Resources
- Questions
