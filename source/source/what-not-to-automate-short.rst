Why Do We Automate?
-------------------

* To save time & money

  * Maintenance & education
* For consistency | stability | fewer mistakes
* Visibility
* Because we don't enjoy a task

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

* What are the impacts?
* Are parameters limited and well understood?
* Codifying unconscious bias
* **Are profits and costs fairly distributed?**

What Not to Automate
--------------------

* Low-volume tasks
  
  * Instead write great docs on how to do it!

* Tasks that require human context
* Complex tasks
* High-risk tasks

  * Instead, have human 'check points' to verify high-risk tasks

  Necessity, not desire. I do not collect them. I am not a toilet seat

  think, oh go on then, just one more toilet seat, I&#39;ll treat
  myself.</p>&mdash; Jac Rayner (@GirlFromBlupo) <a
