What is Open Source?
--------------------

* `What Free Software Means to Me`_ by Matthew Garrett
* More complicated than you might think

.. _What Free Software Means to Me: http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/30420.html

Why Should You Contribute?
--------------------------

.. rst-class:: build

* Don't reinvent the wheel!
* Give back to a project you use + love
* Encourage collaboration, innovation, and **diversity**
* Increase the quality and standards of software
* Improve a skill

But...
------

.. rst-class:: build

* I’m not a good enough programmer to contribute to open source
* I don’t know the repo well enough to contribute
* I don’t write code, so I have nothing to contribute
* I’m just a student / community member / manager / llama, I don’t have anything to contribute
* Contributing to open source is hard
* Contributing to open source doesn’t benefit me at all

Turns Out
=========

There are more ways to contribute than you might expect!

File Bugs
---------

.. rst-class:: build

* Bug tracker?
* Github issue?
* Email to customer service?

.. note::

    The most powerful way all of us can contribute to better software
    is by filing bugs! Whether you can't submit a 'Review' form on
    Nordstrom's website, or can't (insert super technical thing here),
    giving feedback to organizations about how their software could be
    better is invaluable. The only reason we make software is for
    people to use!

Write Documentation
-------------------

* Contribute to official documentation
* Add a README
* Write a blog post

.. note::

    This could be documentation for the Git repo or project website,
    or it could even be a blog post about getting started doing
    something and resources you found helpful. There are *so many
    times* I spend hours digging around the internet for a solution,
    and if I wrote the blog post for the solution I find I save
    someone else that time.

Translate
---------

* Documentation! Slides! Or even just the README

Answer Questions
----------------

* In github issues
* On IRC
* On `StackOverflow`_

.. _StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com

Educate
-------

* Give a talk!
  * This can also be at a User Group meeting, bar camp, or other event
* Represent an open source project at an event

Design
------

* A logo
* A helpful diagram
* A new feature

Finding a Project
-----------------

* `Explore Github`_
* `What Can I Do For Mozilla`_
* `Openhatch`_
