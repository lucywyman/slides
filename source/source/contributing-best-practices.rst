Contributing Best Practices
===========================

Focus on Contrib to Modules

- Include examples
- Keep module modular
  - Break your module down into smallest module pieces
  - Keep discreet, version separately
  - Express relationship in dependencies, not by baking in
- Be mindful of other OSs, even if you don't care about them
- Style guide (duh) (just if you start from scratch) (puppet lint)
- class layout + parameter naming
- don't hardcode
- Document!!
  - What does your task/module do?
  - How does it do it?
  - How should someone use it?
  - Examples if possible!
- Versioning
  - X.0.0 for breaking change
  - 0.x.0 for new non-breaking functionality
  - 0.0.x for backwards compatible bug fixes
- Test
