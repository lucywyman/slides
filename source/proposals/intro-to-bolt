Bolt is an open source remote task runner that executes ad hoc tasks,
scripts, and commands across your infrastructure and applications. It's ideal
for managing tasks that have intermediary states, and integrates with
existing Puppet tools to provide resource management, tasks associated with
modules, and visibility and logging.

In this talk we'll cover:

* What Bolt is
* Bolt Basics: Tasks, Plans, and Configuration
* Advanced Bolt: Applying puppet code, Task Libraries, and Privilege Escalation
* A demo of Bolt in action

This talk is for anyone! Whether you're a veteran Puppet user whose modules are
riddled with 'exec' statements, or you're new to configuration management and
looking to quickly automate tasks across your infrastructure, this
talk will give you the tools you need to manage your infrastructure both
imperatively and declaratively.
