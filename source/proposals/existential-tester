The Existential Tester: How to Assess Risk and Prioritize Tests

Short Description

To test, or not to test?  That is the question.  With limited time and
resources there are only so many tests we can write and run. How do you
determine what features of a new project to test? How do you know when a test
is obsolete, or needs to be updated? What gets run per-commit, nightly, or

To test, or not to test?  That is the question.  With limited time and resources there are only so many tests we can write and run. How do you determine what features of a new project to test? How do you know when a test is obsolete, or needs to be updated? What gets run per-commit, nightly, or weekly? What should you test manually?  This talk will give you a framework for thinking about how to assess risk on a project and prioritize your
tests accordingly.  This talk is ideal for developers looking to make their test suites more efficient or learn more about quality assurance and testing in general. If your tests are taking hours, are difficult to run, or you have no tests to speak of, this talk is for you! We'll discuss:
* What you need to consider when determining how risky a new project or feature is 
* Potential pitfalls of this approach and how to avoid them
* Examples, including why a particular feature was assigned a risk level
* And tools you can use for determining how effective your tests are
 
After this talk you'll know where to start writing tests, where to trim the fat, and how to know you're doing it right. See you there!
