Bio:
I'm a Quality Assurance Engineer for Puppet Labs, where I automate tests and
develop testing infrastructure for puppet orchestrator, PCP, and PE core.  I
graduated from Oregon State University with a BS in Computer Science in June
2016, where I worked as a Front-End Engineer for the OSU Open Source Lab.  In
my free time I enjoy hanging out with friends, hiking, experiencing new things,
and enjoying a wide variety of podcasts, tv shows, blogs, books, and other
media.
