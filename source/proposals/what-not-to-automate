During a talk at DevOps Days Seattle the speaker stated "Automate as much as you can". While this seems like an obvious statement at first blush, on further inspection there are a number of exceptions to this rule, begging the question: What shouldn't I automate? This talk will give you a framework for deciding whether something is worth automating. We'll discuss:

    The return on investment of time to automate
    The ethical considerations of automating particular tasks, such as hiring
    Things that require humans intervention
    And more!

We'll consider this question through the lens of economics, business, ethics, and psychology to explore the wide world of automation and it's consequences.
