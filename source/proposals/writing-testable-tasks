Writing Testable Bolt Tasks and Plans
-------------------------------------

Bolt is great at automating ad-hoc tasks, but how do you know if your tasks
are doing what you expect? Or, more importantly, if they're not doing what
you expect. This talk will provide an overview of Bolt features that help you
write testable tasks and plans. We'll cover:

* Best practices for testable task scripts
* Tools in Bolt for debugging your plans
* How to fail gracefully if something goes wrong
* Using the Bolt RSpec helper library to write unit tests

This talk is for anyone who uses Bolt! Whether you're just getting started
and want to ease your development process, or already have a number of tasks
and modules that you're hoping 'just work', this talk will provide tools to
ensure your code does what you expect.
