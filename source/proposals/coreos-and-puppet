Puppet probably isn't the first tool you think of when you want to manage your
container infrastructure. But when it comes to modeling your infrastructure,
addressing configuration drift, and managing the state of resources (including
Kubernetes primitives), configuration management is the best tool for the job.
Using Puppet in concert with Container Linux and Kubernetes can help you take
your integration and delivery processes to the next level. This talk will cover
the why, what, and how: why you would want to manage Container Linux with
Puppet, what use cases Puppet is most appropriate for, and how to set up an
application running on Container Linux that's managed by Puppet. See you there!
