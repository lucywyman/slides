This talk is for you, the documentarian, developer, student, or community
member wondering what you can contribute to open source and how to get started
Contributing to open source is a great way to give back to a project you care
about, grow a community around software, and help make a project more useful.
But often those who want to contribute have a few assumptions or misconceptions
that prevent them from making that first pull request, including:

* I’m not a good enough programmer to contribute to open source
* I don’t know the project well enough to contribute
* I don’t write code, so I have nothing to contribute
* I’m just a student / community member / manager / llama, I don’t have anything to contribute
* Contributing to open source is hard
* Contributing to open source doesn’t benefit me at all

In this talk I'll discuss several ways open source projects need your help,
what to look for in a project you’re contributing to, and some first steps to
making your first pull request. The truth is that everyone who uses a
technology can help that technology, whether by submitting a bug report,
correcting a spelling error in documentation, submitting a patch to fix a bug,
adding unit tests, updating dependencies...the list goes on.

Topics include:
* Common things a repository may need help with (legal, documentation, bug reporting, updates, etc.)
* Skills you have, and how to use them to help a project
* Determining what a repository needs
* What to look for in a repository when you’re thinking of contributing
* How to submit your first contribution

Audience
--------

This talk is for anyone interested in contributing to open source (or contributing more to open source), but not sure where to start or not sure what skills they have to contribute. The audience should come away from the talk empowered to make their first pull request, with resources in hand to find a project, find an issue to work on, and make their first contribution. My primary goal is to disprove the assumption that open source contribution means writing code, or needing to understand an entire project in order for your contribution to be meaningful.
