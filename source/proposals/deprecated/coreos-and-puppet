Managing CoreOS and Kubernetes with Puppet: Wat? Why? HOW?

Short Description
-----------------
Puppet probably isn't the first tool you think of when you want to manage
your container infrastructure. But when you want to integrate containers into
your existing infrastructure, address configuration drift, or model your
infrastructure Puppet is the best tool for the job.  This talk will cover
the why, what, and how: why you would want to manage CoreOS and Kubernetes
with Puppet, what use cases Puppet is most appropriate for, and how to set up
an application running in a Kubernets cluster on CoreOS with Puppet.

Long Description
----------------
Puppet probably isn't the first tool you think of when you want to manage
your container infrastructure. But when you want to integrate containers into
your existing infrastructure, address configuration drift, or model your
infrastructure Puppet is the best tool for the job. While we tend to treat
container infrastructure as immutable, in reality it isn't.  Third-party
dependencies, persistent storage, and poorly-written applications can still
change the state of your container and it's underlying OS in ways you don't
expect, and cause things to break without you knowing what's running in the
container or why it's breaking. Puppet can solve for this, providing security
and assurance in your state and helping you have a hybrid infrastructure
that's stable. This talk will cover the why, what, and how: why you would
want to manage CoreOS and Kubernetes with Puppet, what use cases Puppet is
most appropriate for, and how to set up an application running in a Kubernets
cluster on CoreOS with Puppet.
