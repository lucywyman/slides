From AFK to Zero-day

Short Description
-----------------

Join me on a cultural, technical, and philosophical journey through time and
space. Not sure what BDFL, Backus-Naur Form, gparted, astroturfing, or The Evil
Bit are? I've got you covered. This talk aims to introduce common phrases,
tools, protocols, cultural references, and other tech jargon to help you keep
up with technical discussions and learn some great vocabulary! We'll cover some
more useful, day-to-day programming terms like API, grep, and daemon, as well
as some more fun cultural phrases such as fork bomb, quine, and hunter2.
