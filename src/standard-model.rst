Basically...
------------
The standard model is a way of describing, mapping, and understanding the interactions of subatomic particles.  This is related to the elusive Theory of Everything, where we aim to describe the interactions of the most basic constituents of matter and essentially understand everything that happens.  

It also tells us where we are on that journey up to this point.

The Jargon
----------

* There are many fancy word that get thrown around when we talk about the Standard Model.  The concepts they talk about tend to be pretty simple, but it can get confusing quickly!

Quarks
------

* Protons, neutrons and electrons are the smallest constituents of matter, right?  Nope!
* Protons and neutrons are made up of elementary particles called quarks
* There are six types of quarks, called "flavors":
 	* Up
	* Down
	* Top
	* Bottom
	* Strange
	* Charm
* Quarks come in pairs according to mass.

Quarks cont'd
-------------

* Up and Down quarks are by far the most common quarks in the universe.  Everything you will ever see or touch is made up of them.

* This is because they have the lowest mass and are the most stable, so heavier quarks tend to decay into up and down quarks very quickly.

Properties of Quarks
--------------------

* **Mass:**  Up quarks are about 2.3 MeV/c^2 and Down quarks are abou 4.8 MeV/c^2, while by comparison the heaviest top quark is about 173.34 GeV/c^2

* **Electric charge:** All quarks either have 2/3 e or -1/3 e .  This is what gives larger materials their own electric charges.  They're the only known particles which do not have integer charges.

.. note:: Color charge:  Wut?  Yeah, quarks have color charge!  Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with their color.  Or color at all, really. Color charge is related to the particle's strong interactions, and is similar to electric charge in that it dictates how particles interact within the context of the strong interaction.  The color scheme was chosen because the interactions are analogous to how red, green and blue interact, and that seemed like a good way of explaining it to somebody.

More properties
---------------

* **Color charge:** Color charge determines how particles interact with each other in relation to the strong force, which is what holds the quarks together.

* **Spin:** Spin is an "intrinsic form of angular momentum" ~ Wikipedia.  It's not exactly like rotational mechanics or how the earth spins on an axis, but does have many similar properties.  Quarks always have 1/2 spin.

.. note:: Bosons will always have integer spins, which cannot be more than 1.  This relates very much to multiple dimensions and finding other bosons, which makes proving that there can be a spin greater than 1 a sort of mini-holy-grail.  Quarks will always have 

* **Baryon number:** used to determine what kind of baryon the quarks make up (ie. baryon, meson, antibaryon, etc.)  Quarks will always have 1/3, as 3 quarks make up a baryon.  We'll come back to this!

Antiquarks
----------
* Every quark has a corresponding **anti-quark**, which has identical properties but some have opposite sign (electric charge)
* **Mesons** are made up of one quark and one anti-quark.  We'll come back to this idea later!

What do Quarks do?
------------------
* As I talked about earlier, quarks are part of the building blocks of the universe.  
* Quarks make up **Hadrons (baryons and mesons)**.  Protons and neutrons, both of which are baryonic hadrons, are both made up of quarks: protons are two up quarks and 1 down quark, while neutrons are two down quarks and 1 up quark (you can do some math with charges to verify this!
* Quarks are also the only elementary particles on the standard model to experience all four fundamental forces.

But what about electrons??
--------------------------
* Electrons are part of a group called **leptons**
* Leptons are unique in that they do not undergo the strong interaction, but are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.
	* The Pauli Exclusion Principle says that two identical fermions (particles with 1/2 spin) of the same particle cannot occupy the same quantum state simulatneously.
	* So they just can't be identical in *all* properties

Leptons cont'd
--------------

* Lepton all come in pairs: a charged particle, and a neutral version of the particle (called a neutrino). 
 	* Electon and electron neutrino--the most common and stable lepton, as we've heard.
	* Muon and muon neutrino
	* Tau and tau neutrino
* Like quarks, the lightest of these is the most stable.

Properties of Leptons
---------------------

* Mass: electrons weight about 2.2 eV/c^2, while taus weigh about 1.77 GeV/c^2
* Electric charge: leptons will always have integer charges
* Spin: Leptons will all have 1/2 spin
* Antileptons are a thing, but they're not as exciting as anti-quarks.  They're part of anti-matter though, just like other anti-things.

What are these leprechauns good for?
------------------------------------

* Electrons hold matter together, so...that's cool!
* Anyone else know?

Gauge Bosons
------------

* Bosons are also known as Force-carrying particles, and they are what "carry" the four fundamental forces.
* This goes a little beyond what you might think though: photons, for instance are considered bosons.
* Bosons:
  	* Gluons: strong-force carrying particles.  These are the reason we're not all just a bunch of quarks floating around.  There's also 8 flavors of gluon.
	* Photon: Carries electromagnetic radiation.  They're awesome cause they have wave-particle duality
	* W and Z bosons: carry the weak force.  W bosons have positive or negative charge, while Z bosons are neutral.
	* Graviton: Gravitons, hypothetically, carry the gravitational force.  They have not been discovered/proved yet though.
 

Boson Properties
----------------

* Bosons all have integer spins. 
* Bosons do not (generally speaking) have mass.
* Some bosons have color charge; ie. gluons (8 linearly independent types) 
* Some have electric charge, but most don't.

How do these all come together?

Whoa, that's a lot of things
----------------------------

* Trying to map things and how they relate to each other.
* Fermions: Include all quarks and leptons.  They are characterized by "Fermiâ€“Dirac statistics and following the Pauli exclusion principle"
	* Fermions also include any particle made up of an odd number of these!  So all baryons and atoms and such.
* Hadron: A composite object made up of quarks.  There are two types of hadrons: mesonic and baryonic.
 	* Baryonic: 3 quarks, everything you know
	* Mesonic: 1 quark and 1 anti-quark, only really seen in high-energy particle collisions
* Bosons: Basically everything that's not a fermion.  Mostly gauge bosons, but mesons are also considered bosons.


How does this all relate to the Standard Model though?
------------------------------------------------------

These basic particles and their properties are what describe interactions and matter in the universe.  

What about the Higgs boson?  Wasn't that a big deal?
