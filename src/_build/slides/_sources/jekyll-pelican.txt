Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Pelican

A comparison of Static site Generators

What even *is* a static site generator?

.. note::

    I asked the all-knowing guru Google this very question, and 
    found there wasn't an explicit definition of what a static
    site generator is. A static site is easy to define -- one that
    doesn't run any code, server or client side.  That is to say
    that there are only html, CSS, and perhaps some purely-aesthetic
    javascript files (for things like expandable menus).  Then
    we can say that an SSG is a tool that take content and 
    generates a static site.

Ok, so what makes a good SSG?

.. note::
    
    Well, it depends on what you want from your static site generator.
    Are you more familiar with python?  Pelican might be 
    the thing for you.  Does everything you use need to be open 
    source?  Free of cost?  There are a lot of factors that go
    into choosing the right SSG.  I chose to focus on some of 
    the factors I really care about in comparing Pelican to Jekyll:
    
    * How well does it work with Github, and/or how easy is it to publish?
    * Does it support restructured text?
    * How easy is themeing?  How customizable is it?

    I've included some other important points in this slide deck,
    but these are some of the things I prioritize in my comparison.

What do other people think?

.. note:: 

    Who cares?  Obviously I'm the expert here. 

    I kid. According to the promising site slant.co:

    * Code highlighting (pygments)
    * Working with Windows
    * Import existing blogs
    * User friendly
    
Things that Jekyll does well:
-----------------------------

* Plays well with Github
* Excellent for blogs
* User friendly if you don't want to mess with HTML/CSS
* Widely used -- every issue has been solved by someone on Stack Overflow
* Written in Ruby

    :align: center

The Cons:
---------

* Doesn't work well with Windows (I guess?)
* Configuring to non-default settings is non-trivial, and can sometimes require plug-ins for basic things (ie. list of posts in a category)


Things that Pelican does well:
------------------------------

* Easy to theme
* Easy to use for a site that isn't a blog
* Excellent documentation, but very little web presence
* Tons of settings, very customizable
* Written in Python

.. figure:: _static/customize_keyboard_key.png
    :align: center

The Cons:
---------
* Non-trivial to use with github (see OSU Security club site)

Things that both do well:
-------------------------

* Work out of the box, relatively easy set up
* Nice default themes
* Open source, on github, and accept pull requests
* Make projects easy to maintain
* Development servers
* Work with Sass and ReStructured text

.. note::

    This is obviously a pretty long list -- there are lots of 
    things that both SSGs do well.  

Things that neither do well:
----------------------------

* Easy for non-computer people
* No graphical user interface. 
* Need to know (or learn) a markup lang
* Non-trivial to include dynamic content

The Conclusion:
---------------

* Well, what do you know; there are pros and cons to both of them!
* Again, it depends on what your priorities are
* But there are other options...
