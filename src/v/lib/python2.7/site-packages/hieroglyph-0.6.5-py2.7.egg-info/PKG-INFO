        **Hieroglyph** is an extension for `Sphinx`_ which builds HTML5 slides
        from ReStructured Text documents.
        
        Installing
        ==========
        
        You can install **Hieroglyph** using ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::
        
           $ easy_install hieroglyph
        
        You can also download the `latest development version`_, which may
        contain new features. Hieroglyph supports Python 2.7 and Python 3.3.
        
        Using Hieroglyph
        ================
        
        You can start a new **Hieroglyph** presentation using the included
        quickstart script::
        
          $ hieroglyph-quickstart
        
        This will generate the Sphinx configuration, along with an optional
        Makefile and batch file, with Hieroglyph enabled.
        
        If you're on something UNIX-like (Linux, Mac OS X, etc), you can then
        generate your slides by running ``make``::
        
          $ make slides
        
        
        You can also add **Hieroglyph** as a Sphinx extension to your
        existing configuration::
        
          extensions = [
              'hieroglyph',
          ]
        
        
        `Read the documentation`_ for all the details about using,
        configuring, and extending Hieroglyph.

        0.6.5
        -----
        
        *Release date: 1 March 2014*
        
        * Revert "Javascript loading is now deferred until the end of the
          document." This caused issues with content in ifnotslides blocks.
          (Issue #33)
        * Fixed an issue with path mangling for generated images (ie, from
          blockdiag).
        * Added support for ``slide_footer`` (Issue #44)
        * Converted slide condition directive processing to use Docutils
          transforms. This allows section headings to appear in tables of
          contents correctly. (Issue #25)
        * Added ``nextslide`` directive for splitting sections.
          (Issue #46)
        * Section classes are now added to the generated slides (Issue #50).
        
        0.6
        ---
        
        *Release date: 8 August 2013*
        
        * The ``note`` directive in a slide now shows up as notes in the
          presenter console. Thanks, Doug Hellmann!
        * Javascript loading is now deferred until the end of the document.
        * Allow projects to specify custom Javascript to be included with
          slides.
        * slides.js now fires an event when the slides are resized.
        * Support setting default classes on slides in a document.
        * Added ``appear`` and ``fade-in`` slide classes for alternate
          transitions.
        * Added ``hieroglyph-quickstart`` script.
        * Added testing framework, initial tests for directives
        * Fixed bug where content was not removed with autoslides was
          disabled
        * Slides created with the slide directive may omit have only a title,
          or only content (Issue #30)
        * Slide numbering was often incorrect when dealing with multiple slide
          levels; this has been correct (Issue #26)
        * Better page break handling when printing slides (PR #31). Thanks,
          tjadevries!
        
        0.5.5
        -----
        
        *Release date: 19 March 2013*
        
        * Rewrote, updated, and expanded documentation, including the addition
          of the Getting Started guide.
        * Added ``inline-contents`` option to the ``slide`` directive.
        * Fixed bug with image path calculation for documents in nested trees.
          This primarily impacted images generated by other extensions, such
          as `blockdiag
          <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sphinxcontrib-blockdiag>`_.
        * Added support for marking a section as a slide when autoslides are
          disabled.
        * All slide-related nodes are now left intact when pruning the tree.
        * Fixed bug related to changing themes between documents that resulted
          in Sphinx reporting Template Not Found.
        * Fixed level calculation for slides created with the ``slide``
          directive.
        * Simplified processing of ``slideconf`` nodes: previously an attempt
          was made to remove them when not building slides. This was fragile,
          and led to breakage in the latex and texinfo builders. They're now
          skipped properly for all builtin Sphinx builders.
        * Updated Javascript for incremental slides to work with recent builds
          of Chrome
        
        0.5
        ---
        
        *Release date: 24 December 2012*
        
        * Added support for ``slide`` directive
        * Added ``autoslides`` config parameter to allow disabling automatic
          generation of slides from document text.
        * Added inline slide builder.
        * Renamed ``slides`` and ``notslides`` directives to ``ifslides`` and
          ``ifnotslides``, respectively. The old names will continue to work
          for a while, the rename just makes them more expressive.
        * Changed key for toggling slide table view to ``t`` (was ``ESC``).
        * Fixed problems with styling nested lists
        * Fixed incompatibility with latex-pdf builder
        
        0.4
        ---
        
        *Release date: 27 September 2012*

        * Template and javascript clean-up/reorganization
        * More accurate display of scaled slides on Slide Table
        * Initial implementation of Presenter Console
        * Themes and docs include font files locally
        * Changed interlink configuration keys to be more consistent.
        * Support for file-specific theme configuration
        * Support for slide numbering

        *Release date: 4 June 2012*
        
        * Provide directory and standalone based builders.
        * Added ``slides`` and ``notslides`` directives.
        * Fix up absolute image paths from things like blockdiag
        * Preliminary support for linking between HTML to Slides
        * Preliminary slide table support
        
        Backward Incompatible Changes:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        * Builders have been renamed to ``slides`` and ``dirslides``. If your
          ``Makefile`` refers to ``html5slides`` or ``dirhtml5slides``, you
          will need to update it.
