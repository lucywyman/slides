<h2>Basically...</h2>

<p>The standard model is a way of describing, mapping, and understanding the interactions of subatomic particles.  This is related to the elusive Theory of Everything, where we aim to describe the interactions of the most basic constituents of matter and essentially understand everything that happens.</p>
<p>It also tells us where we are on that journey up to this point.</p>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="the-jargon">

<h2>The Jargon</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>There are many fancy word that get thrown around when we talk about the Standard Model.  The concepts they talk about tend to be pretty simple, but it can get confusing quickly!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Quarks</h2>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">Protons, neutrons and electrons are the smallest constituents of matter, right?  Nope!</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Protons and neutrons are made up of elementary particles called quarks</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>There are six types of quarks, called &quot;flavors&quot;:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>Up</li>

<li>Top</li>
<li>Bottom</li>

<article class="slide level-2" id="quarks-cont-d">

<h2>Quarks cont'd</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Up and Down quarks are by far the most common quarks in the universe.  Everything you will ever see or touch is made up of them.</li>
<li>This is because they have the lowest mass and are the most stable, so heavier quarks tend to decay into up and down quarks very quickly.</li>
</ul>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="properties-of-quarks">

<h2>Properties of Quarks</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Mass:</strong>  Up quarks are about 2.3 MeV/c^2 and Down quarks are abou 4.8 MeV/c^2, while by comparison the heaviest top quark is about 173.34 GeV/c^2</li>
<li><strong>Electric charge:</strong> All quarks either have 2/3 e or -1/3 e .  This is what gives larger materials their own electric charges.  They're the only known particles which do not have integer charges.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Color charge:  Wut?  Yeah, quarks have color charge!  Unfortunately, it has nothing to do with their color.  Or color at all, really. Color charge is related to the particle's strong interactions, and is similar to electric charge in that it dictates how particles interact within the context of the strong interaction.  The color scheme was chosen because the interactions are analogous to how red, green and blue interact, and that seemed like a good way of explaining it to somebody.</p>
</div>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="more-properties">

<h2>More properties</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Color charge:</strong> Color charge determines how particles interact with each other in relation to the strong force, which is what holds the quarks together.</li>
<li><strong>Spin:</strong> Spin is an &quot;intrinsic form of angular momentum&quot; ~ Wikipedia.  It's not exactly like rotational mechanics or how the earth spins on an axis, but does have many similar properties.  Quarks always have 1/2 spin.</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Bosons will always have integer spins, which cannot be more than 1.  This relates very much to multiple dimensions and finding other bosons, which makes proving that there can be a spin greater than 1 a sort of mini-holy-grail.  Quarks will always have</p>
</div>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Baryon number:</strong> used to determine what kind of baryon the quarks make up (ie. baryon, meson, antibaryon, etc.)  Quarks will always have 1/3, as 3 quarks make up a baryon.  We'll come back to this!</li>
</ul>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="antiquarks">

<h2>Antiquarks</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Every quark has a corresponding <strong>anti-quark</strong>, which has identical properties but some have opposite sign (electric charge)</li>
<li><strong>Mesons</strong> are made up of one quark and one anti-quark.  We'll come back to this idea later!</li>
</ul>




</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="what-do-quarks-do">

<h2>What do Quarks do?</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>As I talked about earlier, quarks are part of the building blocks of the universe.</li>
<li>Quarks make up <strong>Hadrons (baryons and mesons)</strong>.  Protons and neutrons, both of which are baryonic hadrons, are both made up of quarks: protons are two up quarks and 1 down quark, while neutrons are two down quarks and 1 up quark (you can do some math with charges to verify this!</li>
<li>Quarks are also the only elementary particles on the standard model to experience all four fundamental forces.</li>
</ul>

<article class="slide level-2" id="but-what-about-electrons">

<h2>But what about electrons??</h2>

<ul>
<li><p class="first">Electrons are part of a group called <strong>leptons</strong></p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Leptons are unique in that they do not undergo the strong interaction, but are subject to the Pauli Exclusion Principle.</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>The Pauli Exclusion Principle says that two identical fermions (particles with 1/2 spin) of the same particle cannot occupy the same quantum state simulatneously.</li>
<li>So they just can't be identical in <em>all</em> properties</li>
</ul>

<li>Electon and electron neutrino--the most common and stable lepton, as we've heard.</li>
<li>Muon and muon neutrino</li>

</article>
<article class="slide level-2" id="properties-of-leptons">

<h2>Properties of Leptons</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Mass: electrons weight about 2.2 eV/c^2, while taus weigh about 1.77 GeV/c^2</li>
<li>Electric charge: leptons will always have integer charges</li>
<li>Spin: Leptons will all have 1/2 spin</li>
<li>Antileptons are a thing, but they're not as exciting as anti-quarks.  They're part of anti-matter though, just like other anti-things.</li>

<h2>Gauge Bosons</h2>

<ul class="simple">
<li>Bosons are also known as Force-carrying particles, and they are what &quot;carry&quot; the four fundamental forces.</li>
<li>This goes a little beyond what you might think though: photons, for instance are considered bosons.</li>

<h2>Gauge Bosons</h2>

<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Bosons:</dt>

<li>Gluons: strong-force carrying particles.  These are the reason we're not all just a bunch of quarks floating around.  There's also 8 flavors of gluon.</li>
<li>Photon: Carries electromagnetic radiation.  They're awesome cause they have wave-particle duality</li>
<li>W and Z bosons: carry the weak force.  W bosons have positive or negative charge, while Z bosons are neutral.</li>
<li>Graviton: Gravitons, hypothetically, carry the gravitational force.  They have not been discovered/proved yet though.</li>

<h2>Boson Properties</h2>
